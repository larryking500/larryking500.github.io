    <h1> Christmas Tree Decoration </h1>
    <p> 
      It is almost time for Christmas but we have not even bought a tree or the decorations for that tree! Follow a short interactive story of two people who need to buy a christmas tree and decorations. However, the two can not decide on which tree to get or which ornaments to get! You will have to help them decide between 3 different sizes of trees and 3 different sets of decorations. As thanks for helping on deciding the tree and the decorations, this year you get the honors of designing the tree!. You can decide on which decorations you want to choose and click wherever on the tree where you want them and they will be there! I hope you enjoy the interactive story we made!
