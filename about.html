      Im Larry Khun, I am currently 19 and a sophmore at URI. My major is Computer Science and only started taking the required classes for it this semester.
    I am currently trying to adapt to the new onlne learning that is being forced this year, it difficult getting used to this type of learning but I feel like I an 
    adapting well enough. When ever I am not focused on finishing my class work I do have hobbies as well. Some of my hoobies include drawing, gaming, and collecting beyblades.
    The picture to the left is a more current me while the picture to the right is a better picture of me. I do hope you enjoy my website.</p>
